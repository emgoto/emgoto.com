A search bar is a great way to make content on your website discoverable. In this tutorial, we’ll be building an accessible search bar component using React. We’ll also be adding a couple of unit tests for the component with React Testing Library.

The final product we’ll be building will look like this:

<Gif src="/react-search-bar/example.gif" height="258px" alt="GIF of posts being filtered as user types query in search box"/>

> The source code for this tutorial is available at [react-search-bar](https://github.com/emgoto/react-search-bar).

## Render your search bar component in the app
To get started, created a new file for your search component. I've called mine `search.js`:
```jsx:title=src/search.js
const Search = () => {
    return <div>Hello world!</div>
}

export default Search;
```

Then, render this component from inside of your main app file:

```jsx:title=src/App.js
import Search from './search'; // highlight-line

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Search /> // highlight-line
    );
}

export default App;
```

>💡 **Where did `import React from 'react'` go?**
>
> You may notice that we no longer have an import statement at the top of every file. From the release of React 17, this is [no longer necessary](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html). (Yay!) If you happen to be on an older version, you may still need this import statement.


## Add your HTML elements
Our search bar component will contain a couple of HTML elements. Add a label, input and button, and then wrap it all in a form element:
```jsx:title=src/search.js
const SearchBar = () => (
    <form action="/" method="get">
        <label htmlFor="header-search">
            <span className="visually-hidden">Search blog posts</span>
        </label>
        <input
            type="text"
            id="header-search"
            placeholder="Search blog posts"
            name="s" 
        />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
);

export default SearchBar;
```

This will render like this:

### Accessibility and labels
You might be wondering why we are doubling up on the label and placeholder text. 

This is because placeholders [aren’t accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/#placeholder-text). By adding a label, we can tell screen reader users what the input field is for.

We can hide our label from users who can view the placeholder text with a [visually-hidden](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/) CSS class:
```css:title=src/App.css 
.visually-hidden {
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
    white-space: nowrap;
    width: 1px;
}
```
This keeps it visible to screen reader users, but invisible to everyone else.

Now we have a functioning search bar! When you search, you will navigate to `/?s=<your_query_here>`.

## Add a list of posts
Now that we can search, we’ll need a list of items to search from. I've created a list of fake posts:

```js
const posts = [
    { id: '1', name: 'This first post is about React' },
    { id: '2', name: 'This next post is about Preact' },
    { id: '3', name: 'We have yet another React post!' },
    { id: '4', name: 'This is the fourth and final post' },
];
```

Then use the `map` function to loop through and render them:

```jsx:title=src/App.js
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Search />
            <ul>
                {posts.map((post) => ( //highlight-line
                    <li key={post.id}>{post.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Filter the list based on your search query
Our search bar will navigate us to a new URL when we perform a search. So we'll need to grab this value from the URL:

```js
const { search } = window.location;
const query = new URLSearchParams(search).get('s');
```

We’ll also need a function that filters out posts depending on the search query. If the list you’re querying over is simple, you can write your own:
```js
const filterPosts = (posts, query) => {
    if (!query) {
        return posts;
    }

    return posts.filter((post) => {
        const postName = post.name.toLowerCase();
        return postName.includes(query);
    });
};
```

You can also rely on third-party search libraries (like [js-search](https://github.com/bvaughn/js-search)) to filter posts for you.

Using your search query and filter function, you can render only the posts that match your search:

```jsx:title=src/App.js
const App = () => {
    const { search } = window.location;
    const query = new URLSearchParams(search).get('s');
    const filteredPosts = filterPosts(posts, query); // highlight-line

    return (
        <div>
            <Search />
            <ul>
                {filteredPosts.map(post => ( // highlight-line
                    <li key={post.key}>{post.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Now when you type in a query, you will be able to filter your posts!

## Adding immediate search or “search as you type”
Instead of pressing enter to submit your search, you may also want the list to filter as the user begins typing. This immediate response can be more pleasant from a user-experience perspective.

To enable this, you can store a `query` value in your component’s state, and change this value as the user begins typing:
```jsx:title=src/App.js

import { useState } from 'react'; // highlight-line

function App() {
    const { search } = window.location;
    const query = new URLSearchParams(search).get('s');
    const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(query || ''); // highlight-line
    const filteredPosts = filterPosts(posts, searchQuery); // highlight-line

    return (
        <div>
            { /* highlight-range{2,3} */ }
            <Search
                searchQuery={searchQuery}
                setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
            />
            <ul>
                {filteredPosts.map(post => (
                    <li key={post.key}>{post.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```
After you pass in the `searchQuery` and `setSearchQuery` props, you’ll need to make use of it in your input element:
```jsx:title=src/search.js
const SearchBar = ({ searchQuery, setSearchQuery }) => ( //highlight-line
    <form action="/" method="get">
        <label htmlFor="header-search">
            <span className="visually-hidden">Search blog posts</span>
        </label>
        { /* highlight-range{2,3} */ }
        <input
            value={searchQuery}
            onInput={e => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
            type="text"
            id="header-search"
            placeholder="Search blog posts"
            name="s"
        />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
);
```
Now, as soon as you start typing, your posts will begin filtering!

## Adding SPA navigation with React Router

Currently your search bar will do a full-page refresh when you press enter.
If you're looking to build a single-page app (SPA), we'll probably want to use a routing library like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). 

You can install with the following command:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

After installing, wrap your app in React Router's `Router` component:

```jsx:title=src/App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
    return <Router>
        { /* ... */ }
    </Router>
}
```

Then, add the following to the top of your search component:
```jsx:title=src/search.js
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

const SearchBar = ({ searchQuery, setSearchQuery }) => {
    const history = useHistory();
    const onSubmit = e => {
        history.push(`?s=${searchQuery}`)
        e.preventDefault()
    };

    return <form action="/" method="get" autoComplete="off" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
```

Now when a user presses enter, the app's URL will change without a full-page refresh.

## “Search as you type”, SPA navigation and accessibility concerns
Without a full-page refresh, screen reader users won't be notified if the items in the list change. 
We can send these notificaitons using [ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).

After some Googling, there are packages like [react-aria-live](https://github.com/AlmeroSteyn/react-aria-live) and [react-a11y-announcer](https://github.com/thinkcompany/react-a11y-announcer) that will help you do this. 
Unfortunately, it seems like neither of these have been updated in over a year.

Luckily, it is fairly simple to write your own announcer component:
```jsx:title=src/announcer.js
const Announcer = ({ message }) =>
    <div role="region" aria-live="polite" className="visually-hidden">{message}</div>

export default Announcer;
```

And then render this in your main app component:

```jsx:title=src/App.js
<Announcer message={`List has ${filteredPosts.length} posts`}/>
```

Now, as you filter on the list, screen reader users will receive a message letting them know how many posts are on the page.

I don't think that this is a perfect solution, but I definitely think it's much better than having your items silently changing.

> If you are on a Mac and testing its VoiceOver feature, make sure to use Safari! I find that other browsers don't work as well with screen readers.

## Testing your component with React Testing Library
To wrap things up, we’ll be testing our component using React Testing Library.

The first test we’ll be adding is an accessibility check using `axe`. To use it, add the `jest-axe` package to your repository:
```bash
yarn add jest-axe
```
We can use axe to test that our search component does not have any accessibility violations:
```jsx:title=src/search.test.js
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
import Search from '../src/search';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('should not have any accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Search searchQuery='' />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});

```
This is a super simple way to catch simple accessibility issues. For instance, if we removed our label component, our test will fail:
![](./axe-violation.png)

> Axe can’t pick up on all accessibility violations, so still make sure to manually test your component too.

We should also add a test that tests the functionality of your component. Let’s add one that tests when you type “preact”, that it only shows one post:
```jsx:title=src/App.test.js

test('should render one post when user searches for preact', () => {
    render(<App />);

    let posts = screen.getAllByRole('listitem');
    expect(posts.length).toEqual(4);

    const searchBar = screen.getByRole('textbox');
    userEvent.type(searchBar, 'preact');

    posts = screen.getAllByRole('listitem');
    expect(posts.length).toEqual(1);
});

```
## Conclusion
