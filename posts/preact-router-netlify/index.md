If you're deploying your Preact app with preact-router to Netlify, you may find that trying to access anything other than the root of your website (e.g. `foo.netlify.com/bar`) will give you a "Page not found" error.

The recommended approach is to create a `build/_redirects` file and add this line:

```
/*/index.html 200
```

However if this doesn't work for you (it didn't for me), then create a `redirects.txt` file in your root folder, and add the following to your build command in Netlify:

```
npm run build && cp redirects.txt build/_redirects
```
