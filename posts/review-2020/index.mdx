2020 was probably a really strange year for a lot of us. For me, I can definitely see the silver linings - I'm an introvert, and so I've loved being able to work from home, as well as spend more time with my elderly dog.

2020 was also the first year that I set out to _properly_ blog, and so I thought it was worthwhile to do a review post of how my year went.

## A year of writing: some statistics
### My most popular posts on emgoto.com
I published **53 posts** on my website in 2020, and received **26337** page views (according to Google Analytics):

Ignoring the spikes, you can start to see the volume increasing a bit in the second half of the year, as my posts start to show up in Google search results.

My top three posts were the following:

* [Jest code coverage report explained](https://www.emgoto.com/jest-code-coverage/)
* [Storing values with the useRef hook](https://www.emgoto.com/storing-values-with-useref/)
* [Analyze your React appâ€™s bundle size and reduce it using code-splittingÂ ](https://www.emgoto.com/react-bundles-and-code-splitting/)

These aren't particularly exciting topics but theyâ€™re all things that people Google for and want to know the answers to. They were also all written in the first third of the year. Since posts take a while to start showing up in Google search, Iâ€™m hoping that some of the posts I wrote later in the year will start to gain a bit of traction in 2021 too.

### My most popular posts on DEV
After publishing a post on [emgoto.com](emgoto.com/), I will usually also cross-post it to DEV. Initially no one really saw my posts, but as I gained a following this became more of an effective strategy (and something I highly recommend).

I started 2020 on DEV with 6 posts, 60 reactions, 905 views, and 34 followers.

This is what my DEV.to dashboard looked like by the end of the year:

![Dashboard showing my DEV.to statistics](./dev-stats.png)

2820 reactions, 40848 views and 6518 followers!

I published a total of **62 posts** in 2020. This is slightly more than what I published to my own site, since it includes my hackathon submissions and some news/announcement posts.

> I will point out that the follower count is a bit of a false metric. DEV originally had a feature where newcomers to the site were [automatically followed](https://dev.to/ben/changelog-suggested-follows-on-onboarding-3ifb) to 50 other DEV accounts (unless they opted out). My follower count growth dramatically slowed down once DEV changed this feature to be opt-in.

My top three posts (by both views and reactions) were the following:

* [How to take smart notes (as a developer)](https://dev.to/emma/how-to-take-smart-notes-as-a-developer-3og7)
* [How to build a search bar in React](https://dev.to/emma/how-to-build-a-search-bar-in-react-1lcn)
* [My 5 key takeaways from reading the Pragmatic Programmer](https://dev.to/emma/my-5-key-takeaways-from-reading-the-pragmatic-programmer-1959)

Itâ€™s interesting to see that my top-performing posts on my website aren't the same as on DEV. Generally, posts that apply to a wide range of people do better on DEV, like book reviews, or posts on popular technologies like React.

None of my posts were _quite_ popular enough to become one of the [7 most popular posts of the week](https://dev.to/badge/top-7) but I did manage to get the badge for the most popular accessibility post of the week!

### Twitter, my newsletter, and everything else
I went from **36** followers on Twitter to **293**. Iâ€™m not too big of a Twitter user so Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised that I have been gaining a small amount of followers.

I added a newsletter sign-up link to my website back in September, and then proceeded to never actually write one. Iâ€™m still finding a bit daunting to write something thatâ€™s going to end up in peopleâ€™s inboxes. Right now I have **19** subscribers.

I also dabbled in open source, and made 5 commits to [Forem](https://github.com/forem/forem):

## On writing consistently
Back in April, I published [what I learnt from a 16 week writing streak](https://www.emgoto.com/16-week-streak/). On top of that, I would also add two things:

* Even you think the post you wrote is terrible, publish it. And even if you cross-post it to DEV and it doesnâ€™t do well, donâ€™t worry! It may get picked up by the Google algorithm and youâ€™ll start to see a small trickle of visitors over time (maybe even in 6+ months). Writing is a long-term game, and so you shouldnâ€™t be discouraged if you donâ€™t see immediate results.
* If you use Twitter and want to tweet about a post you recently wrote, make sure to tag related accounts. For example, I found that when I wrote posts about the features I added to my Gatsby blog, the Gatsby team would sometimes retweet my tweets if I tagged them. Obviously donâ€™t go overboard and spam people, though.

## 3 things that went well

Outside of my consistency in writing blog posts, I had some other successes worth mentioning:

1. **Winning prizes in two hackathons.** I won a grand prize in the [Twilio x DEV hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-twilio-hackathon-winners-1lp4) and a runnerâ€™s up prize in the [Grant for the Web x DEV hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-grant-for-the-web-x-dev-hackathon-winners-1nl4).
2. **Reading lots!** In 2020 I read 78 books, which is probably the most I've ever read since I was a kid.
3. **Spending money on gym classes.** Joining a gym was the best decision I made in 2020. I didnâ€™t really have the self-discipline to  work out at home, but with gym classes, I know that if I skip one Iâ€™ve wasted my money, and that was a really good motivator to push me to go. I canâ€™t do a proper push-up yet, but I've definitely gotten stronger and Iâ€™m starting to see some muscle definition in my arms so Iâ€™m really happy.

## 2 things that didnâ€™t go well

1. **Trying to do too many things.** At one point I was trying to juggle open source contributions, side projects and writing a new blog post every week, and it was very overwhelming. Iâ€™ve come to realise that I should be kinder to myself, and allow myself more free time instead of trying to do everything and anything. In 2021, Iâ€™m planning on just sticking with writing.
2. **Japanese study.** I find it very hard to consistently study Japanese. Textbooks are so boring! Iâ€™ve decided to take a different approach for 2021, and focus on reading fiction books in Japanese, and hopefully just learn the language through exposure.


## Goodbye 2020 and hello 2021!

Day-to-day, it doesnâ€™t really _feel_ like I did much in 2020, but looking back, I am quite proud of how many posts I did manage to write. With the 60,000+ views I got across my site and DEV, I think it goes to show that consistency can pay off, and I'm keen to see where this consistency can take me into 2021.
